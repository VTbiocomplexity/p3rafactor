            <b><h3>Paired read library</h3></b>

            <p><b>Read File 1 &amp; 2</b></br>
            Many paired read libraries are given as file pairs, with each file containing half of each read pair. Paired read files are expected to be sorted such that each read in a pair occurs in the same Nth position as its mate in their respective files. These files are specified as READ FILE 1 and READ FILE 2. For a given file pair, the selection of which file is READ 1 and which is READ 2 does not matter.</p>

            <b><h4>Advanced Parameters</h4></b>
            <p><b>File 1 Interleaved</b></br>
            Some paired libaries are available in a single file where each read in a pair occurs in succession. To specify such a file set this parameter to 'True'.</p>

            <p><b>Mean Insert Size</b></br>
            This refers to the mean insert size between paired reads. If you have this information you may provide it. If not the assembly algorithm will make an attempt to determine this value.</p>

            <p><b>Std. Insert Size</b></br>
            This refers to the standard deviation of the insert size between paired reads. If you have this information you may provide it. If not the assembly algorithm will make an attempt to determine this value.</p>

            <p><b>Mate Paired</b></br>
            Defines the orientation of read pairs. Setting Mate Paired to true indicates that the sequencing direction of the two reads in each pair is outward facing.</p>

            <p><b>Platform</b></br>
            The sequencing platform used for each library.</br>
            “infer”: Infer sequencing platform from read files; “illumina”: Illumina short reads; “pacbio”: PacBio long reads; “nanopore”: MinION long reads</p>
