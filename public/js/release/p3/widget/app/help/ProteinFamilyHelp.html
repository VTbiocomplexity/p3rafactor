    <h4>FAMILY TYPE</h4>
    <p><b>PATRIC genus-specific families(PLfams):</b></p>
    <p>The genus-specific protein families are computed using only proteins within a genus and more stringent criteria
        (MCL inflation = 3.0).
        This provides higher sequence similarity and better specificity while performing within-genus/species or close
        strain comparisons.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>PATRIC cross-genus families(PGfams):</b></p>
    <p>The cross-genera protein families are computed by clustering representative proteins from the genus-specific
        families with slightly relaxed criteria (MCL inflation = 1.1).
        This allows cross-genera or distant homologs to cluster together, which is necessary to support cross-genera
        comparative analysis across all microbial genomes.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>FIGFams:</b></p>
    <p>FIGfams are sets of isofunctional homologs, i.e. set of rotein sequences that are similar along their full length
        and believed to implement the same function. FIGfams are derived from a collection of functional subsystems, as
        well as correspondences between genes in closely related strains.</p>
