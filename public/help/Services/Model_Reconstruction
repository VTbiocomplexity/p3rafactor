             <h2>Overview</h2>
             <p>The Model Reconstruction Service integrates and augments technologies for genome annotation, construction of gene-protein-reaction (GPR) associations, generation of biomass reactions, reaction network assembly, thermodynamic analysis of reaction reversibility, and model optimization, to generate draft genome-scale metabolic models. The service is capable of generating functioning draft metabolic models of an organism starting from an assembled genome sequence. Additional information is available in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n9/full/nbt.1672.html">High-throughput generation, optimization and analysis of genome-scale metabolic models</>.</p>

        <p>The Metabolic Reconstruction Service can be accessed from the Services Menu at the top of the PATRIC website page and via  the PATRIC Command Line Interface (CLI).</p>
        <p><em>NOTE: You must be logged into the PATRIC Workspace to use the Metabolic Reconstruction Service.</em></p>
